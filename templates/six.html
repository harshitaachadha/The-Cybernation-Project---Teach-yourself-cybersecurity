            <h2>Security Misconfigurations</h2>
            <section>
                <p>Security misconfiguration may be defined as the failure to implement all the security controls for a server or web application, or implementing the security controls but doing so with errors. Security misconfigurations are a wide spread problem and can happen at any level of the application stack. This includes the network services, platform, web server, application server, the database and so on. One of the most common misconfiguration in web applications is the inclusion of default configurations which have never been changed. For instance, some CMS applications are writable by default and allow the user to install whatever extension they want. Others include insecure and incomplete configurations that were intended to be temporary and wrong assumptions about the application’s expected behaviour and network requirements.</p> 

                <p>What is more is that in today’s age of rapidly enhancing technology, new concepts such as hybrid-cloud environments have only increased misconfiguration risks. While in traditional web application environments, security misconfiguration posed threats such as unauthorized access, data exposure, and in organisation threats, the advent of cloud technologies has significantly broadened this threat landscape. This statement can be reinforced by a recent report by IBM which states that in the year 2017 there was a 424% increase in records breached through misconfigurations. This kind of cloud security misconfiguration accounted for about 70% of the overall compromised data for that year. One of the main elements that ay contribute to this problem is the use of public cloud services, third party services, and applications hosted on different infrastructure. This is because attackers can often imitate these external entities and due to gaps in the system security due to misconfigurations conduct large level data heists.</p>

                <p>Another reason behind this may be the firewall misconfiguration which provides a large amount of exposure to the network. Without the right level of visibility, security misconfiguration is opening new risks for heterogeneous environments. These include: (1) Unnecessary administration ports that are open for an application. These expose the application to remote attacks, (2) Outbound connections to various internet services. These could reveal unwanted behaviour of the application in a critical environment.(3) Legacy applications that are trying to communicate with applications that do not exist anymore. Attackers could mimic these applications to establish a connection. According to the OWASP Top 10 2019 document, in order to mitigate the risk of a data breach due to security misconfiguration, a web application should be in possession of the following attributes:</p>

                <p>A repeatable hardening process that makes it fast and easy to deploy another environment that is properly locked down. Development, QA, and production environments should all be configured identically, with different credentials used in each environment. Automate this process in order to minimize the effort required to set up a new secure environment. A minimal platform without any unnecessary features, components, documentation, and samples. Remove or do not install unused features and frameworks. A task to review and update the configurations appropriate to all security notes, updates, and patches as part of the patch management process. In particular, review cloud storage permissions. A segmented application architecture that provides effective and secure separation between components or tenants, with segmentation, containerization, or cloud security groups. Sending security directives to clients, e.g. Security Headers. An automated process to verify the effectiveness of the configurations and settings in all environments.
