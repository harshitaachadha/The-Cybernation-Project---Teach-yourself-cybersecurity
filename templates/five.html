                <p>In cyber security, Access control means to put a limit to what areas a particular user or visitor can access depending upon their needs and levels. Access control enforces policies such that users of the application cannot act outside of their intended permissions. Failure to implement these access controls causes the broken access control vulnerability and lead to unauthorized information disclosure, modification or destruction of all data, or performing business function outside of the limits of the user. In the context of web applications, access control is dependent on authentication and session management. Authentication identifies the user and confirms that they are who they say they are. Sessions management on the other hand identifies which subsequent HTTP requests are being made by that same user. And as an umbrella term for the above two concepts, access control determines whether the user is allowed to carry out the action they are attempting to perform.</p>

                <h3></h3>

                <p>Broken access controls are a commonly encountered and often critical security vulnerability. Design and management of access controls is a complex and dynamic problem that applies business, organizational, and legal constraints to a technical implementation. Access control design decisions have to be made by humans, not technology, and the potential for errors is high. The main issue with the content management systems these days that leads to such vulnerabilities is that they give world wide access to admin login portals, most of the times even without second phase authentication framework in place. Giving access to your login page simply opens up your business application to possibilities of malicious attacks. Broken access control can be used by the attacker to bypass access control checks by modifying the URL, application state or the HTML page. The hacker can allow the primary key to be changed to another user’s record thereby obtaining viewing and editing rights to someone else’s account. Elevation of privileges can be done and as such the attacker can act like a user without being logged in or as an admin when logged as a user.</p>


                <p>According to the OWASP official documentation, the attackers can exploit authorization flows by accessing unauthorized functionalities or data, viewing sensitive files, modifying other users’ data, changing access rights etc. Some of the suggestions to eradicate and minimize broken authentication vulnerabilities are: The least privilege concept should be applied to the web applications. That is application of a role appropriate the current task should exist and nothing more. The accounts that are no longer needed or are no longer in use should be deleted and servers and websites should be audited. Multi-factor authentication should be applied to all the access points of the web application and the access points should remain disabled until needed in order to reduce access windows. Moreover, unnecessary services should be removed from the server. Externally accessible applications should always be verified. Model access controls should be enforced and the application should be designed to incorporate more stringent record ownership. Unique application business limit requirements should be enforced by domain models.
